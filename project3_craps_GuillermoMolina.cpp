//Project 3: Craps Game
/*
 I have to develope an interactive program that will resemble the game Craps.
 The rules are that a player must roll two dice (each with 6 faces numbered 1-6 with no
 repeating numbers). If the sum of both dice is equal to 7 or 11 on the first throw then
 the player will automatically win. If the sum is 2,3, or 12 on the first throw then the
 player loses. If the sum is 4,5,6,8,9, or 1o on the first throw then the sum becomes
 the player's points. In order for the player to win, he must continue rolling the dice
 until your make your point. If the player rolls a 7 before making his point then he
 automatically loses.
 
 
 Some of the things that the program must do is:
 ++Play one or more games
 ++The input will consist of asking the user for their first name and last name
 ++Names may contain imbedded blank spaces
 ++The program will echo print the name as well as the interactive crap gram
